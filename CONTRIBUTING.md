#### TODO
- Spacing around symbols like '+' should depend of context. For instance, f(y+2) should return f(y+2), but 3x²+4y should return 3x² + 4y (notice the spaces). Also, a_{i}-x should return a_{i} - x, but \sum_{i}-x should return \sum_{i}-x (as in \sum_{i}(-x) or -\sum_{i}x). Again, it should take the context in consideration.
- A nice text editor for the input (and settings) box. Like all LaTeX text editor, the color of symbols like '$' should be different than plain text, the color of \commands also, etc.
- Make modifying keyboard shortcuts possible

#### TO(maybe)DO
- Adding new environment like *proof*, *theorem*, etc. with their corresponding style and font.
- New packages are welcomed! However, please submit packages that might benefit multiple users.
- Cleaning up the code (including HTML and CSS) or simply adding comments that helps with code readability is always appreciated!
