Write mathematical expression in UTF format - Convert LaTeX command to text!

With MatTalX (pronounced "Math Talk"), you can convert a simple command, like e^{x} or \alpha into ùëíÀ£ and ùõº respectively. They can then be sent via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Teams, Gmail and every other online platform.

You can finally talk about physics, mathematics, chemistry and (even) chess with your friends! There is more than 1000 commands! They are quite easy to remember, especially if you are already familiar with LaTeX! If not, simply press Alt+S while writing a command to open the suggestion popup!

Copy and paste " H(t) | \psi(t) \rangle = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} | \psi(t) \rangle " in the upper square, click "Convert" and see what happens!

Simple, free and open source!
