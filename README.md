## Presentation from the Chrome webstore and Firefox Add-ons marketplace

Write mathematical expressions anywhere - Convert LaTeX commands to plain text and paste it on any platform!

With MatTalX (pronounced "Math Talk"), you can convert a simple command, like e^{x} or \alpha into ùëíÀ£ and ùõº respectively. They can then be sent via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Teams, Gmail, and every other online platform.

You can finally talk about physics, mathematics, chemistry, and (even) chess with your friends! There are more than 1000 commands and you can even create your own! They are quite easy to remember, especially if you are already familiar with LaTeX! If not, simply open the completion popup!

Copy and paste " H(t) | \psi (t) \rangle = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}| \psi (t) \rangle " in the upper square, click "Convert" and see what happens! 

Simple, free, and open source!


** Documentation **

Full and comprehensive documentation is available if you put your mouse above the question mark (?) on the top right corner of the popup that will appear once you open MatTalX.

## Testing
A basic (and quite specific) test can be run with `bash test.sh liveserver` and `bash test.sh parser`

For a more complete test, we recommend building the extension or add-on (`bash build.sh chrome` or `bash build.sh firefox` respectively) to test it in the browser.

Links for testing in the browser:
